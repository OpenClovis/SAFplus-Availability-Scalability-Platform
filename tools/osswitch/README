This is the osswitch lilo management utility.  It provides a slightly
useful tool for manipulating lilo configuration on our blades.

Here's the output of "osswitch --help":

Usage: ossswitch [--list | --test | --help | label]
Switch the default boot label in LILO

  -l, --list      List available labels in lilo.conf
  -t, --test      Run a selftest function.  NOT FOR CASUAL USERS
  -h, --help      Print this help message and exit

With just the label argument, set the default to that label in lilo.conf
and run lilo

With no arugment, print the current default label from lilo.conf

And there ends the help output.  It's pretty simple to use.  If you
want to find what boot configuration options there are, run with the
--list parameter.  The active config will be marked with a "*".  If
you want to change to a different one, just pass the label of the
desired configuration on the command line.  Then reboot the blade.

The --test option is for development use only.  There is a minimal
self-test function built in to the script.  If you add features,
you might want to add unit tests for the new feature.  You will
probably want to run the script in a test environment if you do.
It should be pretty obvious from the script how you create the
test environment.
