This is the home of the build server scripts and config files. The intended
use of this directory is as follows:

1. Check out directory on a host intended to be a packaging and build server
2. Customize the packaging and build config files from the provided samples
3. Run the packaging script 'autobuild' using a config file in any of the
   following way:
   - manually
   - from a cron job
   - from a script that runs it in an infinite loop

Additional capabilities worth mentioning:

- Multiple builds from different branches can be built in parallel, using
  multiple config files and running the 'autobuild' script for each config
  file separately

- The script can be used to kick off a follow-up script once it successfully
  finished job
  
- The script can automatically upload the generated package files to a remote
  ftp server, provided that it has rsync privileges to the server's target
  directory

- The script can send out an email to a list of defined recipients about the
  success status of the build


Assumptions:

  The top-level dir specified by the config file must have a Makefile with
  the following behavior:
  - it uses the 'all' target to point to the 'pkg' target
  - the 'make pkg' takes care of building the release package
  - The 'make pkg' requires the following environment variables:
        BUILD_ID    - a unique number for the build
        RELEASE_TAG - a release tag to be used in file naming of tarballs
  If the 'make pkg' succeeds, it MUST create a 'manifest' file in the top-level
  directory that contains all files (with full pathname) that are regarded
  as the output of the packaging. These will be uploaded to a release file
  server by the script.
