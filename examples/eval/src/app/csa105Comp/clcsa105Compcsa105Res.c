 * The contructor function is called by the provisioning library when a Managed Object

 * rollback and read are assigned. 
 *
 * There are two variants of these callback functions, one at the object level and 
 * another at the attribute level. The object level functions are used to 
 * group validate/update/rollback/read multiple requests, and the other one is used 
 * to handle one request at a time. If both the callbacks are filled (i.e. non-null),
 * by default the object level callback will be invoked by prov library. To handle 
 * a single request at a time, the object level callbacks has to be set to NULL.
 * 
 * Inside this constructor function, user can add his/her own logic which need to be 
 * done on per object basis. If this logic involves allocation of some resource, 
 * it can be freed in the destructor function, which is called when the Managed 
 * Object is deleted.
