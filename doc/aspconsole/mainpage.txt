 * \section aspconsole_sec_main_1 Introduction
 *  
 * This Reference Guide provides details about managing applications built on 
 * OpenClovis ASP using the ASP runtime debug console commands.
 *  
 * The ASP Console commands can be used to manage, monitor, and test your application.
 * The ASP Console commands are not case sensitive. When you use a command that 
 * is not available, an error message appears along with a list of supported 
 * commands. All ASP Console commands are activated when AMF is executed on the 
 * system controller card. 
 *
 * In addition to the <code>asp_console</code> tool, another utility, 
 * <code>aspinfo</code>, is provided to gather information about 
 * the running system and to offer some limited control capabilities.
