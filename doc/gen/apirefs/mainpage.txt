 *
 * The API Reference Guide defines the Application Programming Interface (API), Model, 
 * and Management Information Model of the OpenClovis Application Service 
 * Platform (ASP) services. This document is written for system integrators, 
 * designers, and system architects. It is also intended for use by application 
 * developers who would use the OpenClovis ASP Services to develop applications 
 * that must be highly available and manageable. It helps the developer understand
 * the capabilities of the OpenClovis ASP services and the APIs that are provided 
 * by each service.
 * 
 * You should be familiar with the OpenClovis SDK User's Guide and a good knowledge
 * of C programming language is required as the APIs are defined using C language.
