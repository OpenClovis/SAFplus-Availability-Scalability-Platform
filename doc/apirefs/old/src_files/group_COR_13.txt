\begin{flushleft}
The ASP COR service provides interfaces to access, modify and manage the life cycle of objects. These objects are called Managed Objects as they contain 
management information about network elements such as a Chassis. They are used to exchange information between system management 
applications and applications running on network elements. The applications running on a network element use or produce management information.
COR objects and metadata associated with these Managed Objects are kept in an in-memory object storage.  
\par
System Management Applications reside outside the network and use the services of a local management agent to interface with COR. These local agents are
referred to as Object Managers (OM).
\par
Applications in a network element that use or produce the management information are referred to as Object Implementers.
An ASP Service can act as an Object Implementer for an object of interest.
\par
Object Manager and Object Implementer are roles performed by applications. In the current implementation of COR, COR is unaware of Object 
Manager and Object Implementer roles and does not enforce any semantics related to these roles. It is assumed that the OM and OI roles
are maintained by careful application design.        
\par
Currently, COR does not provide support for system management applications to use their own agents while interacting with network elements.
Management agents would need to gain exclusive control of a set of managed objects temporarily to perform some change. In the current implementation, it 
is assumed that multiple Object Managers, if present, co-operate with each other while managing or making changes to objects.

\chapter{Service Model}
\section{Usage model}
The users of COR are:
\begin{Desc}
\item
[Management Applications (North-bound)]


COR provides services to enable create/delete/set operations that management applications would need to provide configuration values. 

\item[Object Implementor]
A component can register with COR to perform the role of an Object implementer. The OI contains CORs run-time attributes which provide the current status 
of the object they implement. When a management application requires this run-time information, it must
contact the OI of that object. An OI implements any change in the object provided to it during the life time of the object. 
\par
An OI requires the configuration information from COR during its initialization. It uses COR's {\tt{get}} functionality to obtain this information.
\par
COR provides notification services that triggers an event when specified objects are created, deleted, or set.  An application can subscribe 
to these events and specify event filters to narrow down their scope of interest.

\section{Functional Description}
\subsection{Managed Object Class Characteristics}
\subsubsection{COR MO-Class and MSO-Class}

A MO COR-class is a collection of attributes. Each class has a name. An MO-class has two services associated with it:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provisioning service 
\item
Alarm service
\end{itemize}

COR groups related attributes of these two services in two different Managed Service Object Class (also called MSO class).
Thus, an MO class has two different MSO classes. One corresponding to Provision-able attributes and the other corresponding to Alarm 
attributes. The MSO class also has a name and a list of attributes.
\par
ASP Alarm service determines the structure of the Alarm MSO class and uses this class to model alarms. 
\par
The Provision-able MSO class structure is defined by the application. From the modeling perspective, it is only the Prov MSO class that is of interest 
to the application. For example, a GigePort class can have a group of provision-able attributes (MTU size) and a group of alarms (such as LOS, LOF
and so on). 
COR considers these two groups as two distinct MSO classes associated with GigePort class. An MSO class is identified by an MO class and its Service-ID 
The Service-ID indicates if the MSO is Provision-able or corresponding to Alarm. The enumeration, {\tt{ClCorServiceIdT}}, specifies the service ID of a class.

\subsubsection{MO tree and Containment}

All Managed Objects in COR are organized in a tree hierarchy called the MO tree. The relationship of an MO to its parent MO in the hierarchy is referred 
to as its "containment" relationship. An MO can only be contained in MOs belonging to other MO classes. The rules related to permitted containment relations 
are part of the definition of an MO Class.

\par
The containment relationship allows COR to organize all MOs in a tree and is therefore mandatory from COR's perspective.
Containment relationship is of no other significance to COR. However, it can have some special significance to management applications as some OIs 
can be interested in a group of related objects (in a sub-tree). For example, a sub-tree could reflect the containment of the 
availability management service (AMS) related objects and this containment can have special significance to AMS.

\subsubsection{Blueprint for the MO Tree}

The MO Class definitions and the permitted containment relations in COR are also referred to as the "blueprint" for the MO tree. This blueprint 
refers to the complete set of object metadata associated with a COR instance. COR permits objects to be created and attached to a tree according to the 
blueprint. This blueprint can be constructed using the OpenClovis Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The blueprint is exported in the COR XML
file and imported by COR when it is initialized for the first time. The blueprint is kept in the COR's persistent storage referred to as COR-DB. 
COR obtains the blueprint from COR-DB during its subsequent startup.

\subsection{MO Attributes}
\subsubsection{Attribute characteristics}
Each MO attribute has the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Name
\item
Type associated with attribute values
\item
Default value
\item
Qualifier
\item
Sub qualifiers
\end{itemize}
The qualifiers supported are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
CONFIG
\item
run-time
\end{itemize}

The sub-qualifiers supported are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
cached
\item
persistent
\item
initialized
\item
writable
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attribute Types Supported}
\begin{Desc}
\item[Integer and String types]\end{Desc}

The supported types are signed and unsigned integers of various sizes. Arrays of these integer types are also supported.  For integer types, 
a maximum, minimum, and default value can be specified.


\subsubsection{Caching and Persistence of COR objects}
All COR metadata and objects are persisted in the COR-DB. However, the attribute values are not always persisted. This control can be exercised at 
the object attribute level. Persisted object attributes are restored in a COR instance automatically after a GMS-Cluster reboot.
\par 
COR stores the values of attribute in the memory. This is referred to as caching. Caching results in better read access times for cached attributes. Caching of 
data is not required when the cached data can quickly become stale. Controls are provided to prevent caching of this type of data. These are explained in
subsequent sections.  

\subsubsection{Attribute Qualifiers}
Every attribute must be qualified as a CONFIG, run-time or KEY. These qualifiers are mutually exclusive.


\begin{Desc}
\item
[Configuration Attributes]
A configuration attribute is always persisted and cached. Configuration attributes contain data provided by the Object Managers. They are read-only from
the perspective of the Object Implementer.



\begin{Desc}
\item[Run-time Attributes]
A run-time attribute is not persisted or cached by default. The following sub-qualifiers (either singly or in any combination) can be associated with a 
run-time attribute:
\begin{itemize}
\item
PERSISTENT - This sub-qualifier for run-time attributes indicates that the attribute must be made persistent by the COR Service.
\item
CACHED - This sub-qualifier for run-time attribute indicates that the attribute must be cached by the COR service.
\end{itemize}
Run-time attributes are used for data provided by Object Implementers. They are read only from an Object Manager's perspective.
A run-time attribute that is cached is updated by the Object Implementer when the value changes. When a read request is made on such a run-time attribute, 
COR reads the value from the cache.
A read request on a run-time attribute that is not cached triggers a synchronous request to the Object Implementer that returns with the value of the
attribute.
\par
For examples:\par
{\tt{run-time + cached ->}} Attribute showing Application log stream file name implemented by the Log service.
\par
{\tt{run-time + cached + persistent ->}} Administrative state of a service unit implemented by AMF.
\par
{\tt{run-time + multi-valued ->}} List of Service Instances currently assigned to a Service Unit, implemented by AMF.

\end{Desc}

\subsection{Object Addressing}
\subsubsection{MOID}

Every object in the COR MO tree has a unique ID referred to as the MOID (Managed Object ID).
Every object has a {\tt{relative\_\-ID}} that is formed from the tuple, {\tt{class\_\-ID}} and {\tt{instance\_\-ID}}, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item
class\_\-ID - uniquely identifies the MO class of which this object is an instance and 
\item
instance\_\-ID - uniquely identifies this instance of the object from other instances having the same parent.
\end{itemize}
The MOID of an object is formed from the tuple, MOID of the parent and {\tt{relative\_\-ID}} of the object.
For example, an AMF Service Unit instance can have the following MOID: 
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1/SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID:3}}
\par
COR provides APIs to manage the life cycle of an object and to read or modify its attributes. The user is required to know the MOID of the 
object or its parents.
\par
A MOID uniquely identifies an object in COR tree. However, the MOID is also used to specify ranges of objects. These is called a wild card MOID. A 
wild card {\tt{class\_\-ID}} can represent any class and a wild card {\tt{instance\_\-ID}} can represent any instance. The wild card MOID is used for OI 
subscription and for specifying an MO instance search criteria. Following are some of the examples of a wild card MOID:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1/SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID:*}}\par
Specifies all the MO instances of {\tt{SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID}} class under the hierarchy. \par
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1}}
\item
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1/*:*}}\par
Specifies all the MO instance of any class under the hierarchy.\par
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1}}
\item
{\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:*/*:*}}\par
Specifies all the MO instance of any class under the sub-tree {\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:*.}}\par
The sub-tree specified by {\tt{COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:*}} covers all the MO instances\par
of {\tt{SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID under COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0/}}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Object Management Interfaces}
\begin{Desc}
\item
[OI and Primary OI]\end{Desc}
An Object Implementer performs several distinct operations in relation to changes in objects. 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Permits or denies an object creation or deletion request.
\item
Permits or denies changes to a configuration attribute value.
\item
Implements a change in a configuration attribute when the change has occurred in COR.
\item
Asynchronously updates a cached runtime attribute in COR as and when the related variable changes internally.
\item
Synchronously provides the value of a (non cached) run-time attribute when requested by COR.
\end{itemize}
Every object can have one or more object implementers. While multiple OI’s can perform the first three activities, there can be only one OI that is 
allowed to perform the last two activities. 

\begin{Desc}
\item
[OI Registration]\end{Desc}
A component can act as an OI for an MO as specified a wild card MOID. For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item
An MO Instance specified through its MoID. For example, the MoID can be 
\par
COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1\/SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID:1\/
\item
Instances of a particular MO Class hanging from a particular hierarchy. 
\par
COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:1\/SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID:*
\item
A complete subTree. Acomponent can specify itself as the OI for the wild card
\par
COR\_\-ROOT\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/APPLICATION\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:0\/SERVICE\_\-GROUP\_\-CLASS\_\-ID:*\/SERVICE\_\-UNITCLASS\_\-ID:*
\end{itemize}
As a component can act as an OI for multiple MO instances corresponding to different MO classes, COR provides a mechanism to associate an OI callback 
functions for each MO class.
\par
The OI and MO association is performed during modeling. Following are the list of OI callback functions provided by COR:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{4in}|}
\hline
 {\bf No.} & {\bf OI Callback Function} & {\bf Description} \\
\hline
         1 & Constructor & COR invokes this function when an MO is required to be created.  An application can embed its custom logic to implement
         MO creation. Currently, MO creation/deletion does not have a validate callback function. \\
\hline
         2 & Destructor & COR invokes this function when an MO is required to be deleted.  An application can embed its custom logic to implement MO
         deletion. Currently, MO creation/deletion does not have a validate callback function. \\
\hline
         3 & Validate & COR invokes this function to validate the attribute that is being set. The semantics of validation is specific to the OI. 
         This function also performs the role of \textit{preparation}. For example, needs to be applied in the 
         \textit{apply} phase if the it is valid. The application of this attribute could require certain resources. Such resources are pre-acquired as a part of the 
         \textit{prepare} semantic. This pre-acquisition reduces the possibility of  a failure in the \textit{apply} operation. \\
\hline
         4 & Rollback & This function frees the pre-allocated resources, acquired in the validate phase. The rollback function is called if another
         \textit{attribute}, part of a transaction fails to validate. \\
\hline
         5 & Apply & This function applies the attribute to the resource. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}  


\begin{Desc}
\item
[COR Session Capability]\end{Desc}

The COR session capability provides a mechanism to execute groups of job in an efficient manner by minimizing the number of RMD calls between the COR 
client, COR server, and Object Implementer. The COR session capability provides a mechanism to execute create/set/delete operations on a group of MOs with
all-are-none semantics as described in this section.
\par
The COR server performs a basic validation on these jobs. If one of the job validation fails, the session becomes invalid and no
operations are performed.

\par
COR determines the OI for each participating MO, and invokes the validate functionality of the OI. If the OIs successfully validate
their MO operation, COR invokes the apply functionality of the OI. COR also internally updates its database with these changes on the MOs. On successful
completion, COR sends a notification for the changed MOs.
\par
If an OI fails validation, COR does not proceed with the apply. COR determines the set of OIs that have completed validation and calls 
the rollback functions.
\par
The following sequence diagrams describe the control flow between COR-client, COR-server, and OIs for the following two cases. 
\begin{itemize}
\item
A session is initiated by \textit{comp1}. In the session \textit{<mod1,attr1> ,<moid2,attr2>} and \textit{<moid3,attr3>} are getting updated.
\item
Both \textit{comp1} and \textit{comp2} are OIs for \textit{<moid1>} ,\textit{<moid2>}, \textit{<moid2>}.
\item
All OIs have the same callback function name. The name of the validate, rollback and apply callbacks are {\tt{oiValidateFxn}}, {\tt{oiRollbackFxn}} and 
{\tt{oiApplyFxn}}. 
\item
Case 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Both OIs validate \textit{<moid1,attr1>} and \textit{<moid2,attr2>}, \textit{<moid3,attr3>} succesfully.
\item
Thus, the apply of these attributes is successful.
\end{itemize}
\item


Case2:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\textit{comp1} successfully validates \textit{<moid1,attr1> ,<moid2,attr2>}, and \textit{<moid3,attr3>}.
\item
\textit{comp2} successfully validates \textit{<moid1,attr1>} and fails validation in \textit{<moid2,attr2>}. A rollback can now be called.
\item
Rollback is called for \textit{comp1} for the attributes: \textit{<mod1,attr1> , \textit{<moid2,attr2>, and \textit{<moid3, attr3>.
\item
Rollback is called for \textit{comp2 for the attributes: \textit{<moid1,attr1> and \textit{<moid2,attr2>.
\item
No attributes are applied.

\item
[COR Bundle Capability]\end{Desc}
The COR bundle capability provides a mechanism to execute groups of jobs in an efficient manner by minimizing the number of RMD calls between COR client, 
COR server, and Object Implementer.  
\par
A bundle can be transactional or non transactional. COR service ensures that the jobs in the transactional bundle execute successfully or
fail. No such restriction exists on a non transactional bundle. A non transactional bundle could contain jobs that are not successfully executed.


\par
A transactional bundle comprises Create-Job, Set-Job, and Delete-Job. A non transactional bundle consists of get-jobs.  

The bundle semantics of executing jobs is performed in four phases by the application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Bundle Creation - A bundle is empty with no jobs associated when it is created. A bundle handle that identifies this bundle is returned.
\item
Job Population -  In the next phase, jobs are added to the bundle. These jobs are queued at the COR client. Every job has a status and
a buffer descriptor. The buffer descriptor contains the value of the attribute to be {\tt{set}} or {\tt{get}}. The success or failure of jobs 
 execution is reflected in the status.

\item
Bundle Apply - An application, upon completion of Job population phase, performs the apply operation synchronously. A synchronous apply sends the 
bundle request to the COR server and waits for the COR server's response for a pre-determined time period. The bundle apply is complete when the response is
received. For a read-Job containing configuration attributes or runtime-cached attributes, values are read from the COR database. Other values of 
runtime attributes are read from the OI. COR merges the value of all these attributes corresponding to different read-jobs of
a particular bundle, from different sources and responds back to the client.

\item
Bundle Finalize

\item
[COR Search Capability]\end{Desc}
COR provides the capability to retrieve objects matching a particular criterion. This criterion is called the filter and the search is termed as 
object-walk based search. Following are the parameters for this search:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Root - The root from where search needs to commence. The root is specified as MoID.
\item
Search criterion - This is also specified as MoID and can contain wild card entries. 
\item
Callback function - that is executed for each matched MO instance.
\end{itemize}
COR provides a mechanism to filter objects based on the value of their attributes. This search is called attribute-walk search.
This search is used in conjunction with object-walk search. 
Object-walk returns all the MO instances that match a particular search criterion. Each of these instance can be filtered based on a particular 
attribute and its value. Following are the parameters for this search:
\begin{itemize}
\item
MO - The MO tree on which the search is required to be performed.
\item
Attribute and its value - that is required to be compared.
\item
Callback function - that is required to be called when the attribute comparison is successful. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{Desc}
\item
[COR Event Generation and Subscription]\end{Desc}
COR generates an event for every object creation/deletion/set operation on the {\tt{COR\_\-EVT\_\-CHANNEL}}. Applications can specify the 
following filters to narrow down their event of interest.
\begin{itemize}
\item
MoId: Specifies the set of objects which is of interest to the application. The MoID can be a wild card MoID.
\item
Operation: Specifies the operation(s) that is of interest to the application. An operation can be a combination of Object-create, Object-delete, and 
Object-set activities.
\item
AttributeId: This specifies the attribute of interest.
\end{itemize}

whereas the service ID of an MO object is invalid in the {\tt{{\tt{MoId}}}}. So, you must be careful while creating an MSO object. When

\item[Description:]This is a generic function which is used to set all types of attributes. The {\tt{clCorObjectAttributeSet()}} function uses 
the transaction agent to set the object attribute. The first argument is the transaction ID. For a simple transaction, the transaction ID is set to
{\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-SIMPLE\_\-TXN}}. A transaction that involves setting of multiple attributes for multiple MOs is termed as Complex Transaction.
An application can atomically create/delete MOs, and set attributes through a transaction. \par
 To initiate a complex transaction, you must initialize the {\tt{txnSessionId}} variable to zero and pass {\tt{txnSessionId}} as first 
 argument to the {\tt{clCorObjectAttributeSet()}} function. The function then returns a transaction ID, {\tt{txnSession}}. This ID must be passed as
 the first parameter for subsequent invocations of {\tt{cl\-Cor\-Object\-Attribute\-Set/cl\-Cor\-Object\-Create()/cl\-Cor\-Object\-Delete()}} APIs.
 \par 
 A Complex transaction is terminated through a call to {\tt{clCorTxnSessionCommit()}}. 
 \par
 A simple attribute is defined by the enum {\tt{Cl\-Cor\-Type\-T}}. For simple attributes (such as {\tt{Cl\-Uint8T}}, {\tt{Cl\-Int32T}}), the index 
 parameter is -1. The index parameter is used only for an array attribute. It specifies the element number of the array, that must be operated upon. For
 simple attribute, {\tt{attrpath}} is NULL.

\item[pFilter Usage:] pFilter is used to apply filters to the walk criteria. It can take the following values:

	{\tt{pFilter = NULL}}
No filter is applied and it walks through all the attributes of the object.
	{\tt{pFilter>baseAttrWalk = CL\_\-TRUE}}
Walks through the attributes of the base object (native attributes of the object pointed by objH).
	{\tt{pFilter>baseAttrWalk = CL\_\-FALSE}}
Does not walk through the native attributes.
	{\tt{pFilter>contAttrPath = CL\_\-TRUE}}
Walks through the attributes of the base object (native attributes of the object pointed by objH).
	{\tt{pFilter>contAttrPath = CL\_\-FALSE}}
Does not walk through the native attributes.
	{\tt{pFilter>pAttrPath = NULL}}
	No filter is applied on the attribute path. It walks through all possible attribute paths. The attribute path can be specified with wildcards 
	either in attrId and index or in both. For example,{\tt{\*attrA*\*attrB\**}}. Specifying the attrPath refines the scope of the search.
	{\tt{pFilter>cmpFlag} }
This comparison flag is for attrId with a specified value which can be one of the following:
     {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-CMP\_\-FLAG\_\-VALUE\_\-EQUAL\_\-TO}}: The attributes whose value is equal to the specified value are matched.
      {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-CMP\_\-FLAG\_\-VALUE\_\-LESS\_\-THAN}}: The attributes whose value is greater than the specified value are matched.
      {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-CMP\_\-FLAG\_\-VALUE\_\-LESS\_\-OR\_\-EQUALS}}:
          The attributes whose value is greater than or equal to the specified value are matched.
      {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-CMP\_\-FLAG\_\-VALUE\_\-GREATER\_\-THAN}}:
          The attributes whose value is less than the specified value are matched.
      {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-CMP\_\-FLAG\_\-VALUE\_\-GREATER\_\-OR\_\-EQUALS}}:
          The attributes whose value is less than or equal to the specified value are matched.
	{\tt{pFilter>attrWalkOption} }
			This can have one of the following values:
			{\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-WALK\_\-ALL\_\-ATTR}}: All attributes of the base object are considered 
						for walk operation if pFilter>cmpFlag.

                 	{\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-WALK\_\-ONLY\_\-MATCHED\_\-ATTR}}: 
           	{\tt{pFilter>pValue}} 
Pointer to the value for which the comparison needs to be performed. If it is set to NULL, an attribute value based search is not performed. Otherwise, 
a value comparison is performed based on the cmpFlags of the filter for all the attributed walked.

           	{\tt{pFilter>size}} 
The size of the value to be compared.

	           	{\tt{pFilter>index} }
For a SIMPLE attribute, index id is set to {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-INVALID\_\-ATTR\_\-IDX}}.
\end{Desc}

\begin{Desc}
\item[Description:] 
This function is used to perform a walk through the object attributes (including the ones contained) based on the filter. The attribute walk takes the 
object handle as the first parameter. This can be obtained from the MOID by using the function {\tt{clCorObjecthandleGet()}}. 
\par
The second parameter is the Filter for the attribute walk. This filter is NULL if there is no need for a filter. But if the search is based on filter, 
all the elements of the filter are initialized. 
One of the elements of the filter is {\tt{baseAttrWalk}}. It must be initialized to {\tt{CL\_\-TRUE}} if it is required 
for the walk to be performed on the base class attributes along with the child objects.
The element {\tt{contAttrPath}} is a boolean variable. It must be set to {\tt{CL\_\-TRUE}} if the walk should be performed through the contained MO
and {\tt{CL\_\-FALSE}} if the walk should not be performed through the contained MO. 
{\tt{pAttrPath}} is a pointer to the containment path if the search should begin from a particular contained MO.

The element {\tt{attrWalkOption}} can be set to {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-WALK\_\-ALL\_\-ATTR}} or 

If it is set to {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-WALK\_\-ALL\_\-ATTR}}, the walk is performed on all the attributes.
If it is set to {\tt{CL\_\-COR\_\-ATTR\_\-WALK\_\-ONLY\_\-MATCHED\_\-ATTR}}, the comparison flags (when the attr value and its size 
are also specified) are taken.

\par
The  callback function should be specified in the walk invoked for all attributes matching the filter criteria.  

\par 
The fourth parameter is a cookie. This is a parameter passed by the application developer to the callback function and can be used at the application 
developer's discretion. 
\par
The memory allocated for all attributes matching the filter criteria are allocated by the library and are freed when the callback 
function for all the attributes buffers is invoked.

\begin{Desc}
\item[Parameters:]
\begin{description}

\item[{\em channel\-handle:}](in) handle of the COR channel. You are required to allocate this parameter.

\item[{\em changed\-Obj:}](in) Subscriber (Caller) is interested in changes to this object (publisher). This is complete path to the object. Wildcards 
can be used to specify a 'class' or 'subtree' of objects. Refer to {\tt{MoId}} documentation for further details.

\item[{\em p\-Attr\-Path:}](in) To subscribe for contained attributes of contained objects an {\tt{attrPath}} which identifies a contained 
object must be specified. If this path is specified as NULL, the attributes specified in 
attr\-List belong to the object specified by changed\-Obj parameter. The {\tt{attrPath}} can have wildcards as instances.

\item[{\em attr\-List:}](in) If the subscriber is interested in notification when certain attribute(s) of an object change, list of these attribute
Ids can be specified here. If it is set to NULL, the subscriber receives notification when any attribute changes.
\par
 Following are the critical usage restrictions for this parameter:
\par
 This parameter is interpreted only if \#ops contains one or more {\tt {\_\-SET\_\-}} operations. Refer to {\tt{ClCorOpsT}} for all the possible 
operations types.
\par
 Attribute Ids in {\tt{attrList}} make meaning, when the combination of {\tt{changed\-Obj}} and {\tt{svc\-Id}} resolve in one object 
class. This implies that you are interested at a attribute level change.
 \par
 You cannot use a wildcard for the service ID.
 \par
 You cannot use a wildcard for any class value in {\tt{changed\-Obj}}.
 \par
 You can use a wildcard for instance value in {\tt{changed\-Obj}}.


\item[{\em flags:}](in) The operation you can subscribe for can be:
 \par

 {\tt{CREATE}} 
  \par

 {\tt{DELETE}}
  \par

 {\tt{SET}}


\item[{\em cookie:}](in) Subscriber can store an arbitrary cookie value. It is returned as is to the change notification callback.
\item[{\em subscription\-Id:}](in) Subscription ID is provided by the caller of the API. The same subscription Id has to be used while un subscribing.

\chapter*{Glossary}
\index{Glossary@{Glossary}}
\begin{Desc}
\item[Glossary of COR Service Terms:]
\begin{description}

\item[Configuration Attribute] Configuration attributes are the means by which system management applications provide input on the desired sets of 
objects and their handling that an Object Implementer should implement.. 
The set of configuration objects and attributes constitute the prescriptive part of the information model.
\end{description}
\begin{description}

\item[Runtime Attribute] Runtime attributes are also called transient attributes and are read-only. They are owned by the Object Implementors. To read a
runtime attribute the OI needs to be contacted. The run-time objects and attributes form the descriptive part of the Information Model.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Object Implementer] An ASP service or component that implements an object.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Job] A job is an entity that specifies a create/delete/set/get operation on a MO. A job that specifies MO creation is called Create-Job. A job that
specifies MO deletion is called Delete-Job. A job that represents MO set/get is called Set-Job and Get-Job. A Get-Job has an MO and a list of attributes 
that need to be read. 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Bundle] A bundle is a group of jobs. A bundle enables efficient communication between the COR client, COR server, and OI by limiting the number of
RMD calls between them. A bundle can either be operated as a transactional or a non transactional bundle. COR service ensures that all jobs in a 
transactional bundle are either successful or unsuccessful (failures). A nontransactional bundle does not contain such restrictions and can
contain unsuccessfully executed jobs due to error conditions.
