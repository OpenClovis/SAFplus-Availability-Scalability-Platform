SAFplus Cloud Example

This model shows how SAFplus can be deployed in a cloud environment.  The model
is very simple; it just defines 2 system controllers with one application.  This
application is a server that listens for dynamic HA requests.

A new cloud node can add itself and applications into the cluster using a 
command line program located at src/client.  This program can be run on either
the system controller or the new node.

To add a node run:
cloudCfg <controller IP address> add node <node name>

To add an application run:
cloudCfg <controller IP address> add app <app name> <node name>



This should be run before SAFplus is started on the new node.


BUILDING:

1. First install boost.

sudo apt-get install libboost-1.55-all

2. Configure and compile the model as any SAFplus model

3. compile the client:
  cd src/client
  make
