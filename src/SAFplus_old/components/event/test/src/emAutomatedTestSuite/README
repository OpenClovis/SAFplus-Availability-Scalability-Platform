The setup consits of 4 Nodes. The Master Node - sysController0 and Node A, Node B & Node C. 
The EM test Applications App_A, App_B & App_C are run on NodeA, NodeB & NodeC respectively. 
Once the setup is ready the test controller is instantiated which runs all the test cases.

The config files are placed in config directory for convenience. The XML files from this
location must be copied to $ASP_CONFIG.

The following aliases may proves useful:

export EVT_TEST=$CLOVIS_ROOT/SAFplus/components/event/test/unit-test/emAutomatedTestSuite

alias cpxml="cp $EVT_TEST/config/*.xml $ASP_CONFIG/ -vf"
alias emd="cd $EVT_TEST"

CPM is instantiated using the following aliases:

alias cpm="asp_cpm 0 1 1 sysController0 debug"
alias cpa="asp_cpm 0 2 1 NodeA debug"
alias cpb="asp_cpm 0 3 1 NodeB debug"
alias cpc="asp_cpm 0 4 1 NodeC debug"


! Following aliases are needed only if the test applicatins are not instantiated by CPM
alias ema=". $EVT_TEST/config/a_bash.env && asp_emTestApp"
alias emb=". $EVT_TEST/config/b_bash.env && asp_emTestApp"
alias emc=". $EVT_TEST/config/c_bash.env && asp_emTestApp"

Finally the Test Controller is instantiated using -

alias emt=". $EVT_TEST/config/tc_bash.env && asp_emTestCont"


The following aliases help run the CPM as daemons making it possible to execute all the commands in
a shell script. The amf*.xml files need to be updated accordingly. Currently there is an issue in 
this mode. Need to check on a faster machine.

alias cpmd="cpm 1 &"
alias cpad="cpa 1 &"
alias cpbd="cpb 1 &"
alias cpcd="cpc 1 &"

The above aliases could be invoked in the same order (only constraint is that CPM Master must come up
first followed by the other CPM instances and lastly by the Test Controller).

An invocation as below should suffice :

$ cpmd
$ cpad
$ cpbd
$ cpcd
$ emt

NOTE:   This can be included as a part of shell script or an aggregate alias but there may be issues if
        sufficient delay isn't provided between the calls.
