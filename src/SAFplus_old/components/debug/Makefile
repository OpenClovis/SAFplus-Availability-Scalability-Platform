# Description :
#
# Makefile for tmpcomp component client library
#
# This Makefile assumes the following:
#	- CLOVIS_ROOT environment variable is specified properly
#	- Entire source tree under $(CLOVIS_ROOT)/SAFplus is checked out
#
#
################################################################################

# Subdirectories having Makefiles and need recursive escalation:
# common should always be before client and server

#SUBDIRS         := common client server doc test
SUBDIRS          = client server

#
# If you have any ordering dependence among subdirectories, list them as
# target-prerequisite pairs. Example:
# server: common
# client: common
#
server: client

include $(CLOVIS_ROOT)/SAFplus/mk/make-subdir.mk
