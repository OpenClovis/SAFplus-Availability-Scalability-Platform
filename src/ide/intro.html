<br/>

This tool allows engineers to interactively define a cluster model, and then export that model to XML and generate project source code for all defined applications.
<br/><br/>
<p>To begin, create a new project using the "File" menu.</p>
<p>Next, define types of applications, nodes, service groups, and other Service Availability Forum (SAF) defined entities.  This is done through UML modelling in the "Modelling" tab, and you may configure specific details about these entity types in the "Model Details" tab.  
<i>If you are unfamiliar with SAF high availability, please learn about it now.</i>  </p>
<p>

<p>Finally, create node and application instances in the "Instantiation" tab.  Drag application instances between node instances to select which nodes run which applications.  You may also fine tune the behavior of specific instances in the "Instance Details" tab.
</p>
