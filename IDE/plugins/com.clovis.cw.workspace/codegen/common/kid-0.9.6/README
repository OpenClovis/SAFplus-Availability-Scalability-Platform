About
-----

Kid is a simple Python based template language for XML vocabularies. It was
spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between XSLT, TAL, and PHP.
We believe many of the best features of these languages live on in Kid with
much of the limitations and complexity stamped out.

System Requirements
--------------------

Kid has been tested with Python 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 on Linux, Windows XP
and Mac OS X.

Install
-------

Extract the source tarball, change into the newly created directory, and
execute `setup.py`. Something like the following should do::

    $ gzip -dc kid-0.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    $ cd kid-0.x
    $ python setup.py install

Without any extra arguments to ``setup.py``, this will install the following
items:

  1. Python libraries to your site-packages directory.

  2. The ``kidc`` and ``kid`` commands to your "scripts" directory. This
     is usually ``/usr/local/bin`` under Linux.

Use ``python setup.py install --help`` for information on tweaking the
install.
