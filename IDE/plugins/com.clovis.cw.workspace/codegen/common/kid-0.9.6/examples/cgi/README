Kid CGI Demo
============

The files in this directory provide a quick look at how one might use
kid in a CGI environment. It is very much a work in progress.

Configuration
-------------

1. Ensure that `kid_handler.cgi` is executable by Apache.

2. Add the following to your `.htaccess` or `httpd.conf`:

       Action kid-file /location/of/kid_handler.cgi
       AddHandler kid-file .kid

3. Put the `sysinfo.kid` somewhere reachable by the webserver
   (/var/www, .../htdocs, etc).

4. Hit it and see what happpens.
