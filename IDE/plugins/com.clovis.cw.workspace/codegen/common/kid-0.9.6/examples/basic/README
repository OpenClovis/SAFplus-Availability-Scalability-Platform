Kid Static File Demo
====================

The `sysinfo.kid` file illustrates some of the features of the kid
template language. There are a variety of methods of executing the
template. Try them all to get a feel for what's possible with kid
templates:

   * Execute using the `kid` command line utility:

        $ kid sysinfo.kid
        [template output to stdout]

   * Play around using interactive python:

        $ python
        $ Python 2.3.3 (#2, Dec 23 2003, 22:56:29) 
        [GCC 3.1 20020420 (prerelease)] on darwin
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> import kid
        >>> kid.enable_import()
        >>> import sysinfo
        >>> s = sysinfo.serialize()
        >>> print s
        [lots of stuff to stdout]
        >>> fo = open('/tmp/kid-test', 'wb')
        >>> sysinfo.write(fo)
        >>> fo.close()
        >>> print open('/tmp/kid-test', 'r').read()
        [lots of stuff to stdout]
