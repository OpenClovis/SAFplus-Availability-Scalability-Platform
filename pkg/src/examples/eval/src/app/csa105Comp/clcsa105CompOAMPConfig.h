 *
 *  \par Description:
 *  This function is used to validate single job at a time, which is sent
 *  by the north bound station. This job can be CREATE, DELETE or SET operation.
 *  The application having this callback is the object implementer of the managed
 *  resource. A job is MOID of the object for which create or delete is done, or
 *  a MOID plus attribute Id for which set is done.
 *  The north bound request lands in COR, from where it is routed to the object
 *  implementer(s). This callback is executed in the context of OI to validate
 *  the request sent by the north bound management station, before it is updated
 *  in the OI.
 *
 *  This is one of the callback function along with update and rollback which are
 *  used to implement the transaction's ACID semantics in object implementer. These
 *  callbacks are called by the provisioning library.
 *  The object modification request is sent from the north bound. This request can
 *  be a create or delete operation or it can be a set operation on an attribute
 *  on the managed resource, containing single job or multiple jobs. Using transaciton
 *  semantics the jobs are applied to all the OIs in an all or nothing semantics.
 *
 *  For a request containing single job, this callback is called only once. If
 *  it returns success then the clcsa105CompCSA105RESProvUpdate() will be
 *  called otherwise clcsa105CompCSA105RESProvRollback() is called for
 *  rolling back the job.
 *  In the case of request containing multiple jobs, validate callback is called
 *  multiple times that is once for each job. If this function returns success for
 *  all the jobs, then clcsa105CompCSA105RESProvUpdate() is called for each
 *  one of them. If validation function fails at 'r'th job for a multi request 
 *  job rollback will be called for all the first 'r' jobs.
