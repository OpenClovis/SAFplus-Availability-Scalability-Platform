/* General Types - need to be specified correctly for the host architecture */

/* 
**   It is recommended that these types be defined such that the data sizes 
**   and alignment of each data type are as indicated.  The only requirement
**   for source compatibility is that the types be defined to be able to 
**   contain at least the required data (e.g., at least signed 8-bit values
**   must be contained in the data type defined as SaHpiInt8T, etc.)
**   Following the full recommendations for data size and alignment, however,
**   may promote more binary compatibility.
*/

/* The following definitions produce the recommended sizes and alignments
** using the gcc compiler for the i386 (IA-32) platform. 
**
**  Note, some recent versions of the gcc compiler exhibit an apparent bug
**  that makes the __attribute__ statements applied to the typdef's on
**  the 64-bit types below ineffective when those types are used in structures.
**  To workaround that bug, it may be required to add similar __attribute__
**  statements on the typedefs of the derived types SaHpiTimeT and
**  SaHpiTimeoutT, plus on individual 64-bit data items within structure and
**  union definitions in order to align the HPI structures as recommended.  
**  The structures and unions that contain 64-bit data items are:
**  SaHpiSensorReadingUnionT, SaHpiSensorDataFormatT, SaHpiEventT,
**  SaHpiAnnouncementT, SaHpiDomainInfoT, SaHpiAlarmT, SaHpiEventLogInfoT,
**  and SaHpiEventLogEntryT.  For more information, see:
**  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109911

/*
** Time Related Type Definitions
**
** An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds 
** from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
** is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
** year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
** the timezone used.
**
** It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
** in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
** may be more limited than this.
**
** The value -2**63, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
** "unknown/unspecified time".
** 
** Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
** relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts 
** between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:
** 
**     time_t tt1, tt2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**     
**     time(&tt1);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1 * 1000000000;
**     tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:
**
**     struct timeval tv1, tv2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**     
**     gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec * 1000;
**     tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**     tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:
**
**     struct timespec ts1, ts2;
**     SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**     
**     clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
**     saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
**     ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**     ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;
**
** Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
** all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.
** 
** Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
** relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
** case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
** have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
** "time of day" clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
** time of day.
**
** In these cases, times which represent "current" time (in events, for
** example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
** set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
** since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
** years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
** If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
** absolute time.
**
** There is no practical need within the interface for expressing dates prior 
** to the publication of this specification (which is more than five years
** after the "break point" between relative and absolute time). Thus, in all
** instances a time value should be interpreted as "relative" times if the 
** value is less than or equal to SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE (but not equal to 
** SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED which always means the time is not available), or 
** "absolute" times if the value is greater than SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE.

** Text Buffers
**

** RDR, RPT, etc. for variable length strings of data.
**
** The encoding of the Data field in the SaHpiTextBufferT structure is defined
** by the value of the DataType field in the buffer.  The following table
** describes the various encodings:
**
**    DataType                     Encoding
**    --------                     --------
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_UNICODE         16-bit Unicode, least significant byte first.
**                                 Buffer must contain even number of bytes.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS         8-bit ASCII, '0'-'9' or space, dash, period,
**                                 colon, comma, or underscore only.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6          8-bit ASCII, reduced set, 0x20=0x5f only.
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_TEXT            8-bit ASCII+Latin 1
**
**   SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BINARY          8-bit bytes, any values legal
**
** Note: "ASCII+Latin 1" is derived from the first 256 characters of 
**        Unicode 2.0. The first 256 codes of Unicode follow ISO 646 (ASCII)
**        and ISO 8859/1 (Latin 1). The Unicode "C0 Controls and Basic Latin"
**        set defines the first 128 8-bit characters (00h-7Fh) and the 
**        "C1 Controls and Latin 1 Supplement" defines the second 128 (80h-FFh).
**
** Note: The SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS and SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6 encodings
**        use normal ASCII character encodings, but restrict the allowed
**        characters to a subset of the entire ASCII character set. These
**        encodings are used when the target device contains restrictions
**        on which characters it can store or display.  SAHPI_TL_TYPE_BCDPLUS 
**        data may be stored externally as 4-bit values, and 
**        SAHPI_TL_TYPE_ASCII6 may be stored externally as 6-bit values. 
**        But, regardless of how the data is stored externally, it is 
**        encoded as 8-bit ASCII in the SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed 
**        across the HPI.

/*
** Watchdog Structure
** 
** This structure is used by the saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() and 
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() functions. The use of the structure varies slightly
** by each function.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() :
**
**   Log -                indicates whether or not the Watchdog is configured to
**                        issue events. True=events will be generated.
**   Running -            indicates whether or not the Watchdog is currently 
**                        running or stopped. True=Watchdog is running.
**   TimerUse -           indicates the current use of the timer; one of the  
**                        enumerated preset uses which was included on the last
**                        saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function call, or through some
**                        other implementation-dependent means to start the 
**                        Watchdog timer.
**   TimerAction -        indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
**                        times out.
**   PretimerInterrupt -  indicates which action will be taken 
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" milliseconds prior to Watchdog 
**                        timer expiration. 
**   PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time
**                        out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If 
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
**                        will occur concurrently with "TimerAction." HPI 
**                        implementations may not be able to support millisecond
**                        resolution, and because of this may have rounded the 
**                        set value to whatever resolution could be supported.  
**                        The HPI implementation will return this rounded value.
**   TimerUseExpFlags -   set of five bit flags which indicate that a Watchdog
**                        timer timeout has occurred while the corresponding 
**                        TimerUse value was set. Once set, these flags stay 
**                        set until specifically cleared with a 
**                        saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() call, or by some other 
**                        implementation-dependent means.
**   InitialCount -       The time, in milliseconds, before the timer will time
**                        out after the watchdog is started/restarted, or some 
**                        other implementation-dependent strobe is
**                        sent to the Watchdog. HPI implementations may not be 
**                        able to support millisecond resolution, and because 
**                        of this may have rounded the set value to whatever 
**                        resolution could be supported.  The HPI implementation
**                        will return this rounded value.
**   PresentCount -       The remaining time in milliseconds before the timer 
**                        will time out unless a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset()
**                        function call is made, or some other implementation-
**                        dependent strobe is sent to the Watchdog. 
**                        HPI implementations may not be able to support 
**                        millisecond resolution on watchdog timers, but will 
**                        return the number of clock ticks remaining times the 
**                        number of milliseconds between each tick.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerSet():
**
**   Log -                indicates whether or not the Watchdog should issue 
**                        events. True=event will be generated.
**   Running -            indicates whether or not the Watchdog should be 
**                        stopped before updating. 
**                        True =  Watchdog is not stopped. If it is 
**                                already stopped, it will remain stopped,
**                                but if it is running, it will continue
**                                to run, with the countown timer reset
**                                to the new InitialCount.  Note that 
**                                there is a race condition possible 
**                                with this setting, so it should be used
**                                with care. 
**                        False = Watchdog is stopped. After 
**                                saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() is called, a 
**                                subsequent call to 
**                                saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() is required 
**                                to start the timer.
**   TimerUse -           indicates the current use of the timer. Will control 
**                        which TimerUseExpFlag is set if the timer expires.
**   TimerAction -        indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
**                        times out.
**   PretimerInterrupt -  indicates which action will be taken 
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" milliseconds prior to Watchdog 
**                        timer expiration. 
**   PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time 
**                        out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If 
**                        "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
**                        will occur concurrently with "TimerAction." HPI 
**                        implementations may not be able to support millisecond
**                        resolution and may have a maximum value restriction. 
**                        These restrictions should be documented by the 
**                        provider of the HPI interface.
**   TimerUseExpFlags -   Set of five bit flags corresponding to the five 
**                        TimerUse values. For each bit set, the corresponding

** Resource Capabilities
**
** This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource. One resource 
** may support any number of capabilities using the bit mask. Because each entry
** in an RPT will have the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESOURCE bit set, zero is not a
** valid value for the capability flag, and is thus used to indicate "no RPT
** entry present" in some function calls.
**
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESOURCE         
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
**   Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property that their
**   Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
**   for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
**   guaranteed that the deassertion of that event will also
**   trigger an event. Thus, an HPI User may track the state of sensors on the
**   resource by monitoring events rather than polling for state changes.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_AGGREGATE_STATUS 
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION    
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP  
**   Indicates that the resource supports the full managed hot swap model. 
**   Since hot swap only makes sense for field-replaceable units, the 
**   SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU capability bit must also be set for this resource.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_WATCHDOG         
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONTROL          
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU
**   Indicates that the resource is a field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is
**   capable of being removed and replaced in a live system. If
**   SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP is also set, the resource supports
**   the full hot swap model.  If SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP is not
**   set, the resource supports the simplified hot swap model.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_ANNUNCIATOR
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_POWER
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESET
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY_DATA   
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVENT_LOG              
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RDR 
**   Indicates that a resource data record (RDR) repository is supplied
**   by the resource. Since the existence of an RDR is mandatory for all
**   management instruments, this
**   capability must be asserted if the resource
**   contains any sensors, controls, watchdog timers, or inventory
**   data repositories.

** The CurrentTime entry denotes the Event Log's idea of the current time; i.e 
**   the timestamp that would be placed on an entry if it was added now. 
** The Enabled entry indicates whether the Event Log is enabled. If the Event 
**   Log is "disabled" no events generated within the HPI implementation will be
**   added to the Event Log. Events may still be added to the Event Log with
**   the saHpiEventLogEntryAdd() function. When the Event Log is "enabled"

** The OverflowFlag entry indicates the Event Log has overflowed. Events have  
**   been dropped or overwritten due to a table overflow. 
** The OverflowAction entry indicates the behavior of the Event Log when an

**
** Parameters:
**   None.
**
** Return Value:
**   The interface version identifier, of type SaHpiVersionT is returned. 
**
** Remarks:
**   This function differs from all other interface functions in that it

**  
**   This function returns the value of the header file symbol 
**   SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION in the SaHpi.h header file used when the library 
**   was compiled.  An HPI User may compare the returned value to the

**   identify the resource in messages to a human operator.
**
**   Since the resource tag is contained within an RPT entry, its scope is
**   limited to a single domain.  A resource that exists in more than one domain
**   will have independent resource tags within each domain.
**
**   Typically, the HPI implementation will provide an appropriate default value
**   for the resource tag; this function is provided so that an HPI User can
**   override the default, if desired. The value of the resource tag may be
**   retrieved from the resource's RPT entry.
**
**   If a resource is removed from, then re-added to the RPT (e.g., because of a
**   hot swap action), the HPI implementation may reset the value of the
**   resource tag.

** Description:
**   This function returns the ResourceId of the resource associated with the
**   entity upon which the HPI User is running.
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [out] Pointer to location to hold the returned ResourceId. 
**
** Return Value:

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the ResourceId pointer is passed
**      in as NULL.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the entity the HPI User is running on
**      is not manageable in the addressed domain.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_UNKNOWN is returned if the domain controller cannot determine an
**      appropriate response. That is, there may be an appropriate ResourceId in
**      the domain to return, but it cannot be determined.
**
** Remarks:
**   This function must be issued within a session to a domain that includes a
**   resource associated with the entity upon which the HPI User is running, or
**   the SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT return will be issued. 
**
**   Since entities are contained within other entities, there may be multiple
**   possible resources that could be returned to this call. For example, if
**   there is a ResourceId associated with a particular compute blade upon which
**   the HPI User is running, and another associated with the chassis which
**   contains the compute blade, either could logically be returned as an
**   indication of a resource associated with the entity upon which the HPI User
**   was running. The function should return the ResourceId of the "smallest"
**   resource that is associated with the HPI User. So, in the example above,
**   the function should return the ResourceId of the compute blade.
**
**   Once the function has returned the ResourceId, the HPI User may issue 
**   further HPI calls using that ResourceId to learn the type of resource that
**   been identified.

**
**   Event Logs may include RPT entries and resource data records associated

**
**   If an HPI User provides a pointer for an RPT entry, but the Event Log does

**
** Remarks:
**   This function writes an event in the addressed Event Log. Nothing else is
**   done with the event.
**
**   If the Event Log is full, overflow processing occurs as defined by the

**   (SA_ERR_HPI_OUT_OF_SPACE) indicating that the saHpiEventLogEntryAdd() 
**   function did not add the event to the Event Log.  If the Event Log's

**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Identifier for the Resource containing the Event Log.
**       Set to SAHPI_UNSPECIFIED_RESOURCE_ID to address the Domain Event Log.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned if the implementation does not support
**      independent clearing of the OverflowFlag on this Event Log. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not have an Event
**      Log capability (SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVENT_LOG) set.  Note this condition
**      only applies to Resource Event Logs.  Domain Event Logs are mandatory,
**      and should not return this code.
**
** Remarks:
**   The only effect of this function is to clear the OverflowFlag field in the
**   Event Log info record for the specified Event Log.  If the Event Log is 
**   still full, the OverflowFlag will be set again as soon as another entry
**   needs to be added to the Event Log.
**
**   Some Event Log implementations may not allow resetting of the OverflowFlag
**   except as a by-product of clearing the entire Event Log with the 
**   saHpiEventLogClear() function.  Such an implementation will return the
**   error code, SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD to this function.  The OverflowResetable
**   flag in the Event Log info record indicates whether or not the
**   implementation supports resetting the OverflowFlag without clearing the
**   Event Log.

**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using

**   Timeout - [in] The number of nanoseconds to wait for an event to arrive.
**      Reserved time out values:
**      * SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE   Time out immediately if there are no events
**         available (non-blocking call).
**      * SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK       Call should not return until an event is
**         retrieved.
**   Event - [out] Pointer to the next available event.
**   Rdr - [in/out] Pointer to structure to receive the resource data associated
**      with the event.  If NULL, no RDR will be returned.
**   RptEntry - [in/out] Pointer to structure to receive the RPT entry
**      associated with the resource that generated the event.  If NULL, no RPT
**      entry will be returned.
**   EventQueueStatus - [in/out] Pointer to location to store event queue 
**      status.  If NULL, event queue status will not be returned.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST is returned if an HPI User is not currently
**      subscribed for events in this session.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the:
**      * Event pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * Timeout parameter is not set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK, 
**         SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE or a positive value.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT is returned if no event is available to return within
**      the timeout period.  If SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE is passed in the 
**      Timeout parameter, this error return will be used if there is no event
**      queued when the function is called.
**
** Remarks:
**   SaHpiEventGet() will also return an EventQueueStatus flag to an HPI User.
**   This flag indicates whether or not a queue overflow has occurred.  The 
**   overflow flag is set if any events were unable to be queued because of 
**   space limitations in the interface implementation.  The overflow flag is
**   reset whenever saHpiEventGet() is called.  
**
**   If there are one or more events on the event queue when this function is
**   called, it will immediately return the next event on the queue.  Otherwise,
**   if the Timeout parameter is SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, it will return
**   SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT immediately.  Otherwise, it will block for time 
**   specified by the timeout parameter; if an event is added to the queue
**   within that time it will be returned immediately; if not, saHpiEventGet()
**   will return SA_ERR_HPI_TIMEOUT.  If the Timeout parameter is 
**   SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK, the saHpiEventGet() will block indefinitely, until
**   an event becomes available, and then return that event.  This provides for
**   notification of events as they occur.
**
**   If an HPI User provides a pointer for an RPT entry, but the event does not
**   include a valid ResourceId for a resource in the domain (e.g., OEM or USER
**   type event), then the RptEntry->ResourceCapabilities field will be set to
**   zero.  No valid RPT entry will have a zero ResourceCapabilities.
**
**   If an HPI User provides a pointer for an RDR, but there is no valid RDR
**   associated with the event being returned (e.g., returned event is not a
**   sensor event), then the Rdr->RdrType field will be set to SAHPI_NO_RECORD.
**
**   The timestamp reported in the returned event structure is the best
**   approximation an implementation has to when the event actually occurred.
**   The implementation may need to make an approximation (such as the time the
**   event was placed on the event queue) because it may not have access to the
**   actual time the event occurred.  The value SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED indicates
**   that the time of the event cannot be determined.
** 
**   If the implementation cannot supply an absolute timestamp, then it may
**   supply a timestamp relative to some system-defined epoch, such as system
**   boot.  If the timestamp value is less than or equal to 
**   SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, but not SAHPI_TIME_UNSPECIFIED, then it is
**   relative; if it is greater than SAHPI_TIME_MAX_RELATIVE, then it is
**   absolute.
**
**   If an HPI User passes a NULL pointer for the returned EventQueueStatus
**   pointer, the event status will not be returned, but the overflow flag, if
**   set, will still be reset.  Thus, if an HPI User needs to know about event
**   queue overflows, the EventQueueStatus parameter should never be NULL, and
**   the overflow flag should be checked after every call to saHpiEventGet().
**
**   If saHpiEventGet() is called with a timeout value other than 
**   SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, and the session is subsequently closed from
**   another thread, this function will return with SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_SESSION.
**   If saHpiEventGet() is called with a timeout value other than 
**   SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE, and an HPI User subsequently calls
**   saHpiUnsubscribe() from another thread, this function will return with
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST.

**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned when:
**      * Severity is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**      * The Alarm parameter is passed in as NULL.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned:
**      * If there are no additional alarms in the DAT that meet the criteria

**   
** Remarks:
**   All alarms contained in the DAT are maintained in the order in which they

**
**   Alarm selection can be restricted to only alarms of a specified severity,

**      and Severity is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**   
** Remarks:
**   An HPI User acknowledges an alarm to indicate that it is aware of the alarm
**   and to influence platform-specific alarm annunciation that may be provided
**   by the implementation.  Typically, an implementation ignores acknowledged
**   alarms when announcing an alarm on annunciation devices such as audible
**   sirens and dry contact closures.  However, alarm annunciation is 
**   implementation-specific.
**
**   An acknowledged alarm will have the Acknowledged field in the alarm entry
**   set to True.
**
**   Alarms are acknowledged by one of two ways: a single alarm entry by AlarmId
**   regardless of severity or as a group of alarm entries by Severity 
**   regardless of AlarmId.  
**
**   To acknowledge all alarms contained within the DAT, set the Severity
**   parameter to SAHPI_ALL_SEVERITIES, and set the AlarmId parameter to 
**   SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.
**
**   To acknowledge all alarms of a specific severity contained within the DAT,

**
**   To acknowledge a single alarm entry, set the AlarmId parameter to a value
**   other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED.  The AlarmId must be a valid identifier
**   for an alarm entry present in the DAT at the time of the function call.
**
**   If an alarm has been previously acknowledged, acknowledging it again has no
**   effect.  However, this is not an error.
**
**   If the AlarmId parameter has a value other than SAHPI_ENTRY_UNSPECIFIED,

**      * SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY     Get first entry.
**      * SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY      Reserved as delimiter for end of list. Not a
**         valid entry identifier.
**   NextEntryId - [out] Pointer to location to store EntryId of next entry in
**      RDR repository.
**   Rdr - [out] Pointer to the structure to receive the requested resource data
**      record.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource contains no RDR records
**      (and thus does not have the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RDR flag set in its RPT
**      entry).
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if an EntryId (other than
**      SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY) is passed that does not correspond to an actual
**      EntryId in the resource's RDR repository.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if:
**      * SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY is passed in to EntryId.
**      * NextEntryId pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * Rdr pointer is passed in as NULL.
**   
** Remarks:
**   Submitting an EntryId of SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY results in the first RDR being
**   read. A returned NextEntryId of SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY indicates the last RDR has
**   been returned. A successful retrieval will include the next valid EntryId.
**   To retrieve the entire list of RDRs, call this function first with an
**   EntryId of SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and then use the returned NextEntryId in the
**   next call. Proceed until the NextEntryId returned is SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.
**
**   A resource's RDR repository is static over the lifetime of the resource;
**   therefore no precautions are required against changes to the content of the
**   RDR repository while it is being accessed.

**      If NULL, the sensor event states will not be returned.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is

**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support sensors,

**   
** Remarks:
**   For sensors that return a type of SAHPI_SENSOR_READING_TYPE_BUFFER, the
**   format of the returned data buffer is implementation-specific.
**
**   If the sensor does not provide a reading, the Reading structure returned by
**   the saHpiSensorReadingGet() function will indicate the reading is not
**   supported by setting the IsSupported flag to False.
**
**   If the sensor does not support any event states, a value of 0x0000 will be
**   returned for the EventState value.  This is indistinguishable from the
**   return for a sensor that does support event states, but currently has no

**   determine if the sensor supports any event states.
**
**   It is legal for both the Reading parameter and the EventState parameter to

**   This can be used to determine if a sensor is present and enabled without

**      the sensor's assert event mask should be set or cleared. (But see
**      Remarks concerning resources with the SAHPI_EVT_DEASSERTS_CAPABILITY
**      flag set.)
**   DeassertEventMask - [in] Bit mask or special value indicating which bits
**      in the sensor's deassert event mask should be set or cleared.  (But see
**      Remarks concerning resources with the SAHPI_EVT_DEASSERTS_CAPABILITY
**      flag set.)
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support
**      sensors, as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_SENSOR in the resource's RPT
**      entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the Action parameter is 
**      SAHPI_SENS_ADD_EVENTS_TO_MASKS, and either of the AssertEventMask or 
**      DeassertEventMask parameters include a bit for an event state that is
**      not supported by the sensor.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the Action parameter is out of 
**      range.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the sensor is not present.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if the sensor does not support updating
**      the assert and deassert event masks (i.e., the EventCtrl field in the
**      Sensor RDR is set to SAHPI_SEC_READ_ONLY_MASKS or SAHPI_SEC_READ_ONLY).
**   
** Remarks:
**   The bits in the sensor assert and deassert event masks that correspond to
**   '1' bits in the bit-mask parameters will be set or cleared, as indicated
**   by the Action parameter.  The bits in the sensor assert and deassert event
**   masks corresponding to '0' bits in the bit-mask parameters will be
**   unchanged.
**
**   Assuming that a sensor is enabled and event generation for the sensor is
**   enabled, then for each bit set in the sensor's assert event mask, an event
**   will be generated when the sensor's corresponding event state changes from
**   deasserted to asserted.  Similarly, for each bit set in the sensor's
**   deassert event mask, an event will be generated when the sensor's
**   corresponding event state changes from asserted to deasserted.
**
**   For sensors hosted by a resource that has the
**   SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS flag set in its RPT entry, the assert and
**   deassert event masks cannot be independently configured.  When 
**   saHpiSensorEventMasksSet() is called for sensors in a resource with this
**   capability, the DeassertEventMask parameter is ignored, and the
**   AssertEventMask parameter is used to determine which bits to set or clear
**   in both the assert event mask and deassert event mask for the sensor.
** 
**   The AssertEventMask or DeassertEventMask parameter may be set to the
**   special value, SAHPI_ALL_EVENT_STATES, indicating that all event states
**   supported by the sensor should be added to or removed from, the
**   corresponding sensor event mask.
**
**   If the sensor assert and/or deassert event masks change as a result of
**   this function call, an event will be generated.

** Description:
**   This function retrieves the current state and mode of a control object.
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   CtrlNum - [in] Control number for which the state and mode are being

**   CtrlMode - [out] Pointer to the mode of the control.  If NULL, the 
**      control's mode will not be returned.
**   CtrlState - [in/out] Pointer to a control data structure into which the

**      number to read is passed in via CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line. 
**      If NULL, the control's state will not be returned.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned if the control is a write-only control,
**      as indicated by the WriteOnly flag in the control's RDR (see remarks).
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support
**      controls, as indicated by the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONTROL in the
**      resource's RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the addressed control is a text
**      control, and the line number passed in CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line
**      does not exist in the control and is not SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the control is not present.
**   
** Remarks:
**   Note that the CtrlState parameter is both an input and an output parameter
**   for this function.  This is necessary to support line number inputs for
**   text controls, as discussed below.  
**
**   In some cases, the state of a control may be set, but the corresponding
**   state cannot be read at a later time.  Such controls are delineated with
**   the WriteOnly flag in the Control's RDR.
**
**   Note that text controls are unique in that they have a state associated
**   with each line of the control - the state being the text on that line. The
**   line number to be read is passed in to saHpiControlGet() via 
**   CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line; the contents of that line of the control
**   will be returned in CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text.  The first line of 
**   the text control is line number "1".
**
**   If the line number passed in is SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES, then
**   saHpiControlGet() will return the entire text of the control, or as much
**   of it as will fit in a single SaHpiTextBufferT, in
**   CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text. This value will consist of the text of
**   all the lines concatenated, using the maximum number of characters for
**   each line (no trimming of trailing blanks).
**
**   Note that depending on the data type and language, the text may be encoded
**   in 2-byte Unicode, which requires two bytes of data per character.
**
**   Note that the number of lines and columns in a text control can be
**   obtained from the control's Resource Data Record.
**
**   Write-only controls allow the control's state to be set, but the control
**   state cannot be subsequently read.  Such controls are indicated in the RDR,
**   when the WriteOnly flag is set.  SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_CMD is returned when
**   calling this function for a write-only control.  
**
**   It is legal for both the CtrlMode parameter and the CtrlState parameter to
**   be NULL.  In this case, no data is returned other than the return code.

**      * CtrlState->StateUnion.Analog is out of range of the control record's

**      * CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text.DataLength, combined with the

**         not set to the Language specified in the RDR.
**      * OEM control data is invalid (see remarks below).
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the:
**      * CtrlMode is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**      * CtrlMode parameter is not SAHPI_CTRL_MODE_AUTO and the CtrlState
**         pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * CtrlState->StateUnion.Digital is not one of the valid enumerated
**         values for this type.
**      * CtrlState->StateUnion.Stream.StreamLength is bigger than 
**         SAHPI_CTRL_MAX_STREAM_LENGTH.
**      * SaHpiTextBufferT structure passed as CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text
**         contains text characters that are not allowed according to the value
**         of CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text.DataType.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_REQUEST is returned when SAHPI_CTRL_STATE_PULSE_ON is
**      issued to a digital control, which is ON (in either manual or auto 
**      mode).  It is also returned when SAHPI_CTRL_STATE_PULSE_OFF is issued
**      to a digital control, which is OFF (in either manual or auto mode).
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned when attempting to change the mode of a
**      control with a read-only mode.
**   
** Remarks:
**   When the mode is set to SAHPI_CTRL_MODE_AUTO, the state input is ignored.
**   Ignored state inputs are not checked by the implementation.
**
**   The CtrlState parameter must be of the correct type for the specified
**   control.
**
**   If the CtrlMode parameter is set to SAHPI_CTRL_MODE_AUTO, then the
**   CtrlState parameter is not evaluated, and may be set to any value by an
**   HPI User, including a NULL pointer. Text controls include a line number
**   and a line of text in the CtrlState parameter, allowing update of just a
**   single line of a text control. The first line of the text control is line
**   number "1".  If less than a full line of data is written, the control will
**   clear all spaces beyond those written on the line. Thus writing a 
**   zero-length string will clear the addressed line. It is also possible to
**   include more characters in the text passed in the CtrlState structure than
**   will fit on one line; in this case, the control will wrap to the next line
**   (still clearing the trailing characters on the last line written). Thus,
**   there are two ways to write multiple lines to a text control: (a) call
**   saHpiControlSet() repeatedly for each line, or (b) call saHpiControlSet()
**   once and send more characters than will fit on one line. An HPI User
**   should not assume any "cursor positioning" characters are available to
**   use, but rather should always write full lines and allow "wrapping" to
**   occur. When calling saHpiControlSet() for a text control, an HPI User may
**   set the line number to SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES; in this case, the entire
**   control will be cleared, and the data will be written starting on line 1.
**   (This is different from simply writing at line 1, which only alters the
**   lines written to.)
**
**   This feature may be used to clear the entire control, which can be
**   accomplished by setting:
**      CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Line = SAHPI_TLN_ALL_LINES;
**      CtrlState->StateUnion.Text.Text.DataLength = 0;
**
**   Note that the number of lines and columns in a text control can be
**   obtained from the control's RDR.
**
**   The ManufacturerId (MId) field of an OEM control is ignored by the
**   implementation when calling saHpiControlSet().  
**
**   On an OEM control, it is up to the implementation to determine what is
**   invalid data, and to return the specified error code.

**   
** Remarks:
**   Deleting an Inventory Data Area also deletes all fields contained within
**   the area.  
**
**   In some implementations, certain Areas are intrinsically read-only.  The 
**   ReadOnly flag, in the area header, indicates if the Area is read-only.
**
**   If the Inventory Data Area is not read-only, but contains a Field that is

**   contains a read-only Field will return an error.

**
** Description:
**   This function returns the Inventory Data Field information from a
**   particular Inventory Data Area and Repository.  
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   IdrId - [in] Identifier for the Inventory Data Repository.
**   AreaId - [in] Area identifier for the IDA.
**   FieldType - [in] Type of Inventory Data Field.
**   FieldId - [in] Identifier of Field to retrieve from the IDA.  Reserved
**      FieldId values: 
**      * SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY     Get first entry.
**      * SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY      Reserved as a delimiter for end of list.  Not
**         a valid FieldId.
**   NextFieldId - [out] Pointer to location to store the FieldId of next field
**      of the requested type in the IDA.
**   Field - [out] Pointer to Inventory Data Field into which the field
**      information will be placed.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support an
**      inventory data repository, as indicated by
**      SAHPI_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY_DATA in the resource's RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT is returned if the:
**      * IDR is not present.
**      * Area identified by AreaId is not present.
**      * FieldType parameter is set to SAHPI_IDR_FIELDTYPE_UNSPECIFIED, and
**         the field specified by the FieldId parameter does not exist in the
**         IDA.
**      * FieldType parameter is set to a specific field type, but a field
**         matching both the FieldId parameter and FieldType parameter does not
**         exist.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if:
**      * FieldType is not one of the valid enumerated values for this type.
**      * The AreaId or FieldId is an invalid reserved value such as
**         SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.
**      * The NextFieldId pointer is passed in as NULL.
**      * The Field pointer is passed in as NULL.
**   
** Remarks:
**   This function allows retrieval of an Inventory Data Field by one of two
**   ways: by FieldId regardless of type or by FieldType and FieldId.  
**
**   To retrieve all fields contained within an IDA, set the FieldType parameter
**   to SAHPI_IDR_FIELDTYPE_UNSPECIFIED, and set the FieldId parameter to
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY for the first call.  For each subsequent call, set the
**   FieldId parameter to the value returned in the NextFieldId parameter.
**   Continue calling this function until the NextFieldId parameter contains the
**   value SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY.
**
**   To retrieve fields of a specific type within an IDA, set the FieldType
**   parameter to a valid Field type enumeration.  Use the FieldId parameter in
**   the same manner described above to retrieve all fields of the specified
**   type.  Set the FieldId parameter to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY to retrieve the first
**   field of that type.  Use the value returned in NextFieldId to retrieve the
**   remaining fields of that type until SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY is returned.

**   
** Remarks:
**   Configuring the watchdog timer with the saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function
**   does not start the timer running.  If the timer was previously stopped

**
**   If the initial counter value is set to 0, then any configured pre-timer
**   interrupt action or watchdog timer expiration action will be taken
**   immediately when the watchdog timer is started.  This provides a mechanism

**   on a Watchdog timeout occurring.
**
**   See the description of the SaHpiWatchdogT structure for more details on the

**   outside of the supported range.
**
**   Some implementations cannot accept all of the enumerated values for

**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_DATA is returned if the passed Announcement->EntryId

**   
** Remarks:
**   All announcements contained in the set are maintained in the order in which
**   they were added.  This function will return the next announcement meeting
**   the specifications given by an HPI User that was added to the set after the
**   announcement whose EntryId and timestamp is passed by an HPI User.   If 
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY is passed as the EntryId, the first announcement in the

**   EntryId and Timestamp passed by an HPI User has been deleted.
**
**   Selection can be restricted to only announcements of a specified severity,
**   and/or only unacknowledged announcements. To retrieve all announcements
**   contained meeting specific requirements, call saHpiAnnunciatorGetNext()
**   with the Status->EntryId field set to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and the Severity
**   and UnacknowledgedOnly parameters set to select what announcements should
**   be returned.  Then, repeatedly call saHpiAnnunciatorGetNext() passing the
**   previously returned announcement as the Announcement parameter, and the
**   same values for Severity and UnacknowledgedOnly until the function returns
**   with the error code SA_ERR_HPI_NOT_PRESENT.
**
**   SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY and SAHPI_LAST_ENTRY are reserved EntryId values, and
**   will never be assigned to an announcement.
**  
**   The elements EntryId and Timestamp are used in the Announcement parameter
**   to identify the "previous" announcement; the next announcement added to the
**   table after this announcement that meets the Severity and
**   UnacknowledgedOnly requirements will be returned.  Announcement->EntryId
**   may be set to SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY to select the first announcement in the
**   current set meeting the Severity and UnacknowledgedOnly requirements.  If
**   Announcement->EntryId is SAHPI_FIRST_ENTRY, then    Announcement->Timestamp
**   is ignored.

**
** Parameters:

**
** Description:
**   This function allows an HPI User to configure a timeout for how long to

**   within a specific domain.  
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using

**   Timeout - [in] The number of nanoseconds to wait before autonomous handling
**      of the hot swap event.  Reserved time out values:
**      * SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE indicates proceed immediately to autonomous
**         handling.
**      * SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK indicates prevent autonomous handling.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if the auto-insert timeout for the domain
**      is fixed as indicated by the SAHPI_DOMAIN_CAP_AUTOINSERT_READ_ONLY flag
**      in the DomainInfo structure.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned when the Timeout parameter is not set
**      to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK, SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE or a positive value.
**   
** Remarks:
**   This function accepts a parameter instructing each resource to impose a
**   delay before performing its default hot swap policy for auto-insertion.
**   The parameter may be set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE to direct resources to
**   proceed immediately to auto-insertion, or to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK to prevent
**   auto-insertion from ever occurring.  If the parameter is set to another
**   value, then it defines the number of nanoseconds between the time a hot
**   swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING is
**   generated, and the time that the auto-insertion policy will be invoked for
**   that resource.  If, during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel()
**   function call is processed, the timer will be stopped, and the
**   auto-insertion policy will not be invoked.  Each domain maintains a single
**   auto-insert timeout value and it is applied to all contained resources upon
**   insertion, which support managed hot swap.
**
**   Once the auto-insertion policy begins, an HPI User will not be allowed to
**   cancel the insertion policy; hence, the timeout should be set appropriately
**   to allow for this condition.  Note that the timeout period begins when the
**   hot swap event with HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_INSERTION_PENDING is 
**   initially generated; not when it is received by an HPI User with a
**   saHpiEventGet() function call, or even when it is placed in a session
**   event queue.
**
**   A resource may exist in multiple domains, which themselves may have
**   different auto-insertion timeout values.  Upon insertion, the resource will
**   begin its auto-insertion policy based on the smallest auto-insertion
**   timeout value.  As an example, if a resource is inserted into two domains,
**   one with an auto-insertion timeout of 5 seconds, and one with an
**   auto-insertion timeout of 10 seconds, the resource will begin its
**   auto-insertion policy at 5 seconds.
**
**   An implementation may enforce a fixed, preset timeout value.  In such 
**   cases, the SAHPI_DOMAIN_CAP_AUTOINSERT_READ_ONLY flag will be set to 
**   indicate that an HPI User cannot change the auto-insert Timeout value. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_READ_ONLY is returned if an HPI User attempts to change a 
**   read-only timeout.

**   
** Remarks:
**   This function accepts a parameter instructing the resource to impose a

**   The parameter may be set to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_IMMEDIATE to direct the resource
**   to proceed immediately to auto-extraction, or to SAHPI_TIMEOUT_BLOCK to 
**   prevent auto-extraction from ever occurring on a resource. If the parameter
**   is set to another value, then it defines the number of nanoseconds between
**   the time a hot swap event with 
**   HotSwapState = SAHPI_HS_STATE_EXTRACTION_PENDING is generated and the time
**   that the auto-extraction policy will be invoked for the resource. If, 
**   during this time period, a saHpiHotSwapPolicyCancel() function call is 
**   processed, the timer will be stopped, and the auto-extraction policy will
**   not be invoked.
** 
**   Once the auto-extraction policy begins, an HPI User will not be allowed to

**   appropriately to allow for this condition. Note that the timeout period
**   begins when the hot swap event with

**   not when it is received by a HPI User with a saHpiEventGet() function call,
**   or even when it is placed in a session event queue. 
**
**   The auto-extraction policy is set at the resource level and is only
**   supported by resources supporting the Managed Hot Swap capability. The
**   auto-extraction timeout value cannot be modified if the resource's "Hot
**   Swap AutoExtract Read-only" capability is set. After discovering that a

**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   State - [out] The current power state of the resource.  Valid power states
**      are:
**      * SAHPI_POWER_OFF: The entity's primary power is OFF,
**      * SAHPI_POWER_ON: The entity's primary power is ON.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned. 
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support power
**      management, as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_POWER in the resource's 
**      RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned if the State pointer is passed in
**      as NULL.
**   
** Remarks:
**   SAHPI_POWER_CYCLE is a pulsed power operation and is not a valid return
**   for the power state.

**
** Name: saHpiResourcePowerStateSet()
**
** Description:
**   This function directs the resource to perform the power control action on
**   the entity that it manages. If a resource manages multiple entities, this
**   function addresses the entity that is identified in the RPT entry for the
**   resource. 
**
** Parameters:
**   SessionId - [in] Identifier for a session context previously obtained using
**      saHpiSessionOpen().
**   ResourceId - [in] Resource identified for this operation.
**   State - [in] the requested power control action.  Valid values are:
**      * SAHPI_POWER_OFF: The entity's primary power is turned OFF,
**      * SAHPI_POWER_ON: The entity's primary power is turned ON,
**      * SAHPI_POWER_CYCLE: The entity's primary power is turned OFF, then
**         turned ON.
**
** Return Value:
**   SA_OK is returned on successful completion; otherwise, an error code is
**      returned.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_CAPABILITY is returned if the resource does not support power
**      management, as indicated by SAHPI_CAPABILITY_POWER in the resource's 
**      RPT entry.
**   SA_ERR_HPI_INVALID_PARAMS is returned when State is not one of the valid 
**      enumerated values for this type.
**   
** Remarks:
**   This function controls the hardware power on a FRU entity regardless of 
**   what hot-swap state the resource is in. For example, it is legal (and may
**   be desirable) to cycle power on the FRU even while it is in ACTIVE state in
**   order to attempt to clear a fault condition. Similarly, a resource could be
**   instructed to power on a FRU even while it is in INACTIVE state, for 
**   example, in order to run off-line diagnostics.
** 
**   Not all resources supporting hot swap will necessarily support this 
**   function. In particular, resources that use the simplified hot swap model
**   may not have the ability to control FRU power. 
**
**   This function may also be supported for non-FRU entities if power control
**   is available for those entities.
