 * AMF Cluster Class Implementation
 * 
 * This file contains functions for handling the AMF cluster. It can be 
 * viewed as the implementation of the AMF Cluster class
 * as described in SAI-Overview-B.02.01. The SA Forum specification 
 * SAI-AIS-AMF-B.02.01 has been used as specification of the behaviour
 * and is referred to as 'the spec' below.
 * 
 * The functions in this file are responsible for:
 *	- to start the cluster initially
 *	- to handle the administrative operation support for the cluster (FUTURE)
 *
 * The cluster class contains the following state machines:
 *	- administrative state machine (ADSM)
 *	- availability control state machine (ACSM)
 *
 * The administrative state machine will be implemented in the future.
 *
 * ACSM handles initial start of the cluster. In the future it will also handle
 * administrative commands on the cluster as described in paragraph 7.4 of the
 * spec. ACSM includes two stable states (UNINSTANTIATED and STARTED) and a
 * number of states to control the transition between the stable states.
 *
 * The cluster is in state UNINSTANTIATED when the cluster starts. (In the
 * future this state will also be assumed after the LOCK_INSTANTIATION
 * administrative command.)
 *
 * State STARTED is assumed when the cluster has been initially started and
 * will in the future be re-assumed after the administrative command RESTART
 * have been executed.

 * 1.2 State Description
 * =====================
 * UNINSTANTIATED -  No SUs within any SG in any Application is instantiated.
 * STARTING_APPLICATIONS - All applications have been requested to start
 *                         their contained SGs, which in its turn has requested
 *                         their contained SUs to instantiate all their 
 *                         components. The cluster startup timer is running.
 * WAITING_OVERTIME_1 - The cluster startup timer has expired but all
 *                      applications have yet not responded that they have been
 *                      started. The time-out message is broadcasted again to
 *						make sure there are no other broadcast messages pending.
 *						(This assures first of all that there is no pending
 *						'component instantiate' message.)
 * WAITING_OVERTIME_2 - The cluster startup timer has expired but all
 *                      applications have yet not responded that they have been
 *                      started. Cluster will wait infinitely for the
 *                      applications to respond. It is correct to do so even when
 *                      the startup timer has expired, because the applications
 *                      will report they are started as soon as there is no
 *                      attempt to instantiate any of its components pending,
 *                      because attempts to instantiate a component can not go on
 *                      forever, see saAmfCompInstantiateTimeout,
 *                      saAmfCompNumMaxInstantiateWithoutDelay and
 *                      saAmfCompNumMaxInstantiateWithDelay.
 * ASSIGNING_WORKLOAD - All applications have been requested to assign it's
 *                      specified workload to it's service units according to
 *                      the redundancy model specified by it's SGs.
 * STARTED - A best effort has been made to instatiate the components of all
 *           applications and assign the specified workload as close as possible
 *           to what is described in the configuration.
 *
 * 1.3 Actions
 * ===========
 * A1 - [foreach application in cluster]/start application
 * A2 - start cluster startup timer
 * A3 - [foreach application in cluster]/assign workload to application
 * A4 - defer sync_ready event
 * A5 - forward sync_ready to appropriate node object
 * A6 - recall deferred event
 * A7 - stop node local instance of cluster startup timer
 * A8 - multicast 'cluster startup timer time-out' event (time_out)
 *
 * 1.4 Guards
 * ==========
 * C1 - Administrative state == UNLOCKED
 * C2 - No SU has presence state == INSTANTIATING
 * C3 - All SGs are fully instantiated
 * C4 - No Application has Availability Control state == ASSIGNING_WORKLOAD
