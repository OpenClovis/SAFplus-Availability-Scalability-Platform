.TH EVS_MCAST_JOINED 3 3004-08-31 "openais Man Page" "Openais Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
evs_join \- Multicasts to all groups joined to an handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/uio.h>
.B #include <openais/evs.h>
.sp
.BI "int evs_mcast_joined(evs_handle_t " handle ", evs_guraantee_t " guarantee ", struct iovec *" iovec ", int " iov_len ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B evs_mcast_joined
function is multicast a message to all the groups that have been joined with the
.B evs_join(3)
function for the argument
.I handle.
Messages that are sent to any of the groups joined to the parameter
.I handle
will be delivered to all processors in the system.
.PP
The argument
.I guarantee
requests a delivery guarantee for the message to be sent.  The evs_guarantee_t type is
defined by:
.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
typedef enum {
	EVS_TYPE_UNORDERED,	/* not implemented */
	EVS_TYPE_FIFO,          /* same as agreed */
	EVS_TYPE_AGREED,	/* implemented */
	EVS_TYPE_SAFE           /* not implemented */
} evs_guarantee_t;
.ta
.fi
.RE

.PP
The meanings of the evs_gaurantee_t typedef are:
.TP
.B EVS_GUARANTEE_UNORDERED
Messages are guaranteed to be delivered, but with no particular order.  This 
mode is unimplemented in the EVS library.
.TP
.B EVS_GUARANTEE_FIFO
Messages are guaranteed to be delivered in first sent first delivery order
from one one.  In fact, this guarantee is actually the AGREED guarantee.
.TP
.B EVS_GUARANTEE_AGREED
All processors must agree on the order of delivery.  If a message is sent
from two or more processors at about the same time, the delivery will occur
in the same order to all processors.
.TP
.B EVS_GUARANTEE_SAFE
All processors must agree on the order of delivery.  Further all processors
must have a copy of the message before any delivery takes place.  This mode is
unimplemented in the EVS library.
.PP
The
.I iovec
argument describes the scatter/gather list which is used to transmit a message.  This
is a standard socket structure described by:
.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
struct iovec
{
	void *iov_base;     /* Pointer to data.  */
	size_t iov_len;     /* Length of data.  */
};
.ta
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP
.PP
The
.I iovlen
argument describes the number of entires in the
.I iovec
argument.  

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the EVS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
