.TH EVS_DISPATCH 3 2004-08-31 "openais Man Page" "Openais Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
evs_dispatch \- Dispatches callbacks from the EVS service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <openais/evs.h>
.sp
.BI "int evs_dispatch(evs_handle_t " handle ", evs_dispatch_t *" dispatch_types ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B evs_dispatch
function is used to dispatch configuration changes or messages from the
extended virtual synchrony API.
.PP
Each application may have several connections to the EVS API.  Each  application
uses the 
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.
.PP
The
.I dispatch_types
argument is used to identify the type of dispatch to execute.  The possible types are
defined by the structure:

.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
typedef enum {
        EVS_DISPATCH_ONE,
        EVS_DISPATCH_ALL,
        EVS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
} evs_dispatch_t;
.ta
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP
.PP
The dispatch values have the following meanings:
.TP
.B EVS_DISPATCH_ONE
Dispatch atleast one callback, blocking until the callback is dispatched.
.TP
.B EVS_DISPATCH_ALL
Dispatch all waiting callbacks without blocking to wait for any callbacks.
.TP
.B EVS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
Dispatch all callbacks blocking indefinately.  This is used in a threaded
program where a thread is created, and then evs_dispatch() is called immediately
from the created thread to execute callbacks.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the EVS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
