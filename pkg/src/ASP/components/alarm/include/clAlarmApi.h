 *  \param alarmInfo (in)Pointer to the structure that contains the alarm information.
 *
 *  \param pAlarmHandle (out)Pointer to the alarm handle. The alarm handle is used by Fault Manager(FM)

 *
 *  \par Description:
 *  This function is used to generate an alarm on a Managed Object (MO). It can be used
 *  by a component to raise an alarm on a resource or on a component itself.
 *  While invoking this function, you must fill the \e ClAlarmInfoT structure
 *  which has the following attributes:
 *
 *  \arg \e moId : The resource on which the alarm is being raised.
 *  \arg \e compName : The name of component which is raising the alarm.
 *  \arg \e alarmState : Flag to indicate if the alarm was for assert or for clear.
 *  \arg \e probCause : Probable cause of the alarm being raised.
 *  
 *  There are certain optional fields of the \e ClAlarmInfoT structure which can be
 *  provided while publishing the alarm:
 *  \arg \e category: The category of the alarm to which it belongs.
 *  \arg \e specificProblem: Specific problem of the alarm. This is to be specified by user.
 *  \arg \e severity : Severity of the alarm.
 *  \arg \e buff : Additional information about the alarm to be specified by the user. 
 *                 This buffer would be allocated by the user and freed after calling 
 *                 this function.
 *  \arg \e len : Length of the additional data about the alarm.
 *
 *  A unique alarm handle is generated by the alarm server and provided back to the component
 *  that raises the alarm. The alarm handle is used by FM to query alarm information
 *  and pass the alarm information to the repair handlers configured while modeling.

 *  The function would fill all the pending alarms in the second parameter. It would fill the count of pending
 *  alarms in pPendingAlarms->noOfPendingAlarm and the list of pending alarms in the pPendingAlarms->pAlarmList.
 *  The pAlarmList is array of ClAlarmHandleInfoT, so it contains alarm handle and other parameters of the alarm.
 *  The alarm handle for the alarm which was raised successfully would be a valid handle generated by alarm server.
