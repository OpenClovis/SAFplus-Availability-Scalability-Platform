To run these unit test cases following these instructions below:

1. We need to run only one node for this test case. However, running more than
   one node will not harm.
2. Compile ASP and deploy it on the target machine. Lest assume that ASP is
   deployed on /root/asp directory on the target machine
3. Do make in this directory. It will generate test_gms_cluster binary in $ASP_BINDIR.
4. Copy test_gms_group binary to /root/asp/bin directory on the target machine.
5. In this directory you have a shell script - 'gms_cluster_test'. Copy this file also to /root/asp/bin.
6. Start ASP on the target machine
7. Run 'gms_cluster_test' script on the target.
