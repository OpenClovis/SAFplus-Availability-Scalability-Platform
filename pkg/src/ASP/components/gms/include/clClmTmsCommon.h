/*******************************************************************************
 * Description :
 *
 * This is the viewer API for the Group Membership Service (GMS).  It allows
 * query and asynhronous tracking of GMS groups.  It does not provide for
 * managing groups (creating, deleteing, joining, leaving).  For that purpose
 * separate additional API components are provided.
 *
 * There are two types of GMS groups covered by this service:
 *
 * - Cluster membership service -- A special type of group membership, where
 *   the members are the [compuing] nodes (processors) in the cluster.
 *
 * - Generalized component (or process) groups -- these are groups of
 *   arbitrary software components, running on the various nodes in the
 *   cluster.  These components are commonly referred as group members. 
 *
 * This API is provided by the GMS client library that can be linked to
 * the application (directly or as part of the EO client environment).
 *
 * This API provides a superset of the SA Forum Cluster Membership (CLM)
 * API, as specified in its B.01.01 version.  A separate, SA Forum compliant
 * API is provided also, as a separate header file supported by a separate
 * set of API functions.
