/**
 * State Machine Library.
 *
 * <h1>FSM Overview</h1>
 * 
 * Clovis State Machine library contains API's to create state
 * machines and their run time instances.  
 *
 * A FiniteStateMachine (FSM) is a representation of an event driven
 * system (a system that is driven by external events that are input
 * into the system). In an event-driven system, the system makes a
 * transition from one state (previous state) to another prescribed
 * new state (new state), provided that the condition that defines the
 * change is satisfied.  In other words, a Finite-state machine is a
 * pre-determined network which has a finite number of states that are
 * interconnected based on the external events that trigger the state
 * transition.
 *
 * A Finite-State machine contains a finite number of
 * states, events and user call-back routines. Simple state machines
 * can be represented by networking a set of states and transition
 * events, and we refer to it as Finite-State Machine (FSM) in this
 * document. Alternatively, complex state machines with a large number
 * of states and transition events are easier to represent and
 * implement using Hierarchical Finite-State Machines. A Hierarchical
 * Finite-State Machine (HSM) can be viewed as a layered state
 * machine, and each state in the layer above containing a
 * finite-state machine within itself. A detailed description follows
 * later in this document. First, lets describe the various building
 * blocks that are utilized in constructing the FSM, next walk through
 * the Start transitions, and finally present a pseudo call graph.
 *
 * Following picture captures a sample state machine:
 *
 * <img src="images/StateMachine.gif"/>
 * 
 * init state: s1 <p>
 * final state: s4  <p>
 * States: s1,s2,s3,s4 <p>
 * At State (s1): Events 'a' and 'b' are handled (using transitions t1,t2) <p>
 * At State (s2): Event c is handled (using transition t3) <p>
 * At State (s3): Event d is handled (using transition t4) <p>
 * Events: a,b,c,d <p>
 * Transitions: t1,t2,t3,t2 <p>
