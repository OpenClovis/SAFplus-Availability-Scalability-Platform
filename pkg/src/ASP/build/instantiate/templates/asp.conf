# NODENAME - This specifies the name of the current node.
export NODENAME=

# DEFAULT_NODEADDR - This is the slot number that will be used for this node.
# It comes from the SLOT_... definitions made in the target.conf.  This is 
# used unless the AUTO_ASSIGN_NODEADDR is enabled.
export DEFAULT_NODEADDR=

# AUTO_ASSIGN_NODEADDR - This can be enabled if you want the slot number
# to come from the chassis, based on where it is physically located 
# instead of having it preassigned.
#
# To disable this feature, it can be undefined, or defined as "disable" or 
# "no".  To enable this, it can be set as "physical-slot".  If enabled, it
# will attempt to retrieve the value using the IPMI driver.  If this
# attempt fails, either due to an IPMI error or the system is not chassis
# based, the node address will fall back to the definition in DEFAULT_NODEADDR.

# OPENHPI_CONF - This specifies the location of openhpi.conf, and 
# is necessary for chassis management to function

# MIBDIRS - This specifies the location of the standard and custom
# SNMP MIBs.
export MIBDIRS="${ASP_DIR}/share/snmp/mibs"

# SNMP_TRAP_ADDR - This is the IP address of the network management station.
# This is important if you are using SNMP traps to send alarms to a 
# management station.  This value is originally set based on the TRAP_IP value
# in the target.conf file.
export SNMP_TRAP_ADDR=

# LINK_NAME - This is the name of network device to be used by the cluster.
# It will likely be eth0 or eth1 in linux.  This value is originally set 
# based on the value in the target.conf file.
export LINK_NAME=

# TIPC_NETID - The netid is used by tipc to keep different clusters separate.
# If you have multiple ASP models running on the same network, they should
# each have a unique TIPC_NETID number.  This value is originally set based 
# on the value in the target.conf file.
export TIPC_NETID=

# ASP_SIMULATION - This is a boolean value (0/1) specifying whether you are
# running an ASP cluster in a simulation or not.  Setting this to 1 allows you
# to run multiple nodes on the same system.
#
# For this to work, there must be a simulated ethernet device for each node
# before the nodes are brought up.  For example, on a two node cluster, you 
# could run these commands to prepare the ethernet devices:
# 
# ifconfig eth0:1 10.0.0.1
# ifconfig eth0:2 10.0.0.2
#
# The numbers appended to the eth0:  (eg eth0:X ) correlate to the slot 
# numbers assigned to those nodes.  So, if your two node cluster had one node
# in slot one, and the other node in slot 3, you would need to type this 
# instead:
#
# ifconfig eth0:1 10.0.0.1
# ifconfig eth0:3 10.0.0.2
#
# This flag can be turned on while running the sdk-4.2/src/ASP/configure 
# script with the --with-asp-simulation flag, or by setting it directly here.
export ASP_SIMULATION=

# SYSTEM_CONTROLLER - This is set to 1 when the current node is a system
# controller node.  For all others, this is set to 0.  A system controller
# node runs a few extra services, such as snmpd, and chassis management.
export SYSTEM_CONTROLLER=

# Run ASP with the following valgrind command.
