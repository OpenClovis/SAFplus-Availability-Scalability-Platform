README for ASP binary package
------------------------------

The directory contains the ASP all the source files required to build
ASP for a given target-platform/target-os. 

To install ASP SDK:

1)  ./configure (./configure --help lists all options)

2)  make

3)  make install (This needs to be executed as 'root' and installs the 
    ASP SDK under '/usr/local/clovis/sdk/2.2'.)

---------------------------
Configure options supported
---------------------------

The following options are supported with the configure script. Further
information can be obtained by running ./configure --help

1) --prefix=PREFIX
    
    This option will set the directory where ASP SDK will be installed.
    By default this is set to /usr/local

2) --without-cm-build

    This option will disable CM server compilation.

3) --without-snmp-build

    This option will disable SNMP server compilation
    
4) --with-model-name=MODEL-NAME

     By default , ASP will be compiled for SampleModel. This will change 
     the model to be compiled to MODEL-NAME and will check if it is present
     under ASP/models directory.

5) --with-cross-build=TOOLCHAIN-NAME

    This option will enable cross compilation and will pick up the build tools
    from /opt/clovis/buildtools/TOOLCHAIN-NAME

6) --with-kernel-build=kernel-dir

    This option is used in conjuction with --with-cross-build option and is used
    to compile ASP for a kernel other than the standard one in the build tools
    directory. 

    eg:- if /opt/clovis/buildtools/ppc-linux-yd26 has two kernels i.e
    linux-2.6.12 and linux-2.6.13 , to specify linux-2.6.12 , the following
    options are passed to configure

    ./configure --with-cross-build=ppc-linux-yd26 --with-kernel-build=linux-2.6.12
    
----------------------
Make targets supported 
----------------------

1) make

    This will compile the ASP binaries with the options passed to configure.

2) make install
    
    This will install ASP SDK to the directory PREFIX (as set by the configure
    script). By default , this will be installed in /usr/local.

    Note : If binaries for multiple architectures are required to be installed ,
    the following steps are to be taken .

    a) Run configure with the appropriate options passed to it .
    b) Run make and make install
    c) Run make clean .
    d) Repeat Steps a to c by passing different arguments to configure script
       to install multiple architectures.

3) make uninstall

    This will install ASP SDK to the directory PREFIX (as set by the configure
    script). By default , this will be installed in /usr/local

4) make rt-package
    
    This will create a ASP RT (Runtime) package which can be used to deploy on
    a target machine.

5) make clean

    This will remove all the binaries compiled for the particular architecture.

--------------------------
NOTE for cross-compilation
--------------------------
Cross-compiling and installing ASP SDK for a particular 
target-platform/target-os, would require installing the buildtools for 
that target-platform/target-os under /opt/clovis. Assuming that relevant
toolchain is installed for 'ppc-linux-yd26' (in '/opt/clovis/builtools'),
the following is the sequence of steps to be followed:

1)  ./configure --with-cross-build=ppc-linux-yd26

2)  make

3)  make install

-------------------
Steps To Start ASP
-------------------

1) After ASP has been compiled by issuing a make , source clasp.env
   source clasp.env

2) Load IOC Kernel modules (as root user) by running clIocLoadModule.sh script
   under scripts directory .
   
   source scripts/clIocLoadModule.sh

3) Change to $ASP_BINDIR directory
   cd $ASP_BINDIR

4) Run the following command to start ASP

   ./asp_amf --chassis=0 --localslot=1 --nodename=SysController_0 --profile=debug
   Substitute the various parameters to asp_amf accordingly.
