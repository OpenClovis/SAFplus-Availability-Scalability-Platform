This is the Platform Support Package needed for all ATCA systems using
AMC cards.

It solves the problem of automatically mapping AMC physical location to
traditional PhysicalSlot numbers that are used in ASP to also identify
nodes.

The content of this directory should be applied to a base installation of
OpenClovis SDK in the following way:
- The content of the pkg-overlay directory should be copied (recursively)
  over to the installed SDK directory
- Then each patch file (in alphabetical order) found in the patches
  subdirectory should be applied from the top SDK  dir (e.g., sdk-3.0)

The install.sh scripts automates that process.
