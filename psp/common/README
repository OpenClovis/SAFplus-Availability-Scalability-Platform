This is the common Platform Support Package needed for all Platforms

The content of this directory should be applied to a base installation of
OpenClovis SDK in the following way:
- The content of the pkg-overlay directory should be copied (recursively)
  over to the installed SDK directory
- Then each patch file (in alphabetical order) found in the patches
  subdirectory should be applied from the top SDK  dir (e.g., sdk-3.1)
